# Glossi

## Overview

![A screenshot of the Glossi landing page. A heading reads "Welcome to Glossi". A navbar has the brand aligned left, and "Reader", Decks", "Scrolls", "Login", and "Sign up" buttons aligned right.](screenshots/1-landing_page_top.png)
[Glossi](https://glossi.lat) is a tool for reading text with unfamiliar words and reviewing new vocabulary.

On Glossi, you can create a *scroll*—a chunk of text, clicking any word inside of which opens a panel populated with dictionary entries from a few select APIs. These entries can be saved to a vocabulary list, or *deck*. Use decks to review your saved words—we call them *cards*—or use the flashcard view to test your memory.

## Add a scroll

In Glossi, it starts with a scroll. Select and copy a chunk of text you might want to read with a dictionary on hand. Paste it in the [add scroll](https://glossi.lat/scrolls/new) form, and submit.

## Look up words in English

Clicking any word in the text triggers a dictionary look up.

Each dictionary covers slightly different ground than the next. Toggle a dictionary by clicking on its title in the dictionary toolbar to find the definition most relevant to you.

Wait - cetology is the study of cetaceans? That's kind of circular. You can click on any word in a definition to look it up.

Much better.

You can also navigate through your lookup history, starting from the word that first openened the panel, using the left and right arrows.

## Look up words in other languages

While Free Dictionary and Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary only have English words, Wiktionary provides every match from any language. The language toolbar, located just below the dictionary toolbar when Wiktionary is open, contains the ISO language code of every language that has a match for your look up (some language codes are grouped under the "other" category).

*Note: At this time, Glossi provides limited support for looking up non-Latin scripts. The degree of this limitation varies with the language and the script: Greek is well-supported, Russian not so much, and Chinese is not supported at all. Apologies for this. In a later version I'd like to have look ups available in every script and language.*

## Save a word for review

Glossi has a cardmaking feature that lets you save words for later review.

Create a card by selecting an entry from the dictionary panel. Click on the addition sign beside the part of speech label to open up the form for making a card, then toggle the definitions you want to include.

## Saving a card to a deck

When you create a card, must add it to an existing deck or create a new one. If you create a new deck, you might want to give it a name that lets you know something about its contents, e.g. "Shakespeare", "Spanish adjectives", "Computer science". If you don't want to create a new deck, you can add it to your default deck.

<!-- *Note: Cards are intended for reviewing specific meanings of a word. Instead of each and every definition associated with a word, a card should contain definitions related to just one entry. For example, consider the word "fly". Is it a bug, is it what birds and airplanes do, or is it slang for "fashionable"? A card should cover only one of those meanings.* -->

## Viewing cards

To view a card, navigate to the decks index, and select the deck that contains the card you're looking for. By default, your deck presents your cards in list view. Scroll until see you the preview for the card you're looking for and click on it.

You can also quiz yourself on the cards you've created. On the deck page, click "Enter flashcard view" beside the deck name. You will then be able to cycle through your cards, seeing first the card's title and part of speech, then its definitions.
